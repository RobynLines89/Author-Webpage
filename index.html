		  <p>Malcom Colley was born in South Africa in 1942. He spent his teens of the 1950's on a small farm just outside Naboomspruit in the Northern Province of South Africa, 
		  during which time he came to love the sounds, smells and sights of the bush. As a young man Malcolm enlisted in the army as most young men did during those days. 
		  He did his basic training with 1st Special Service Battalion in Bloemfontein and has happy memories of army life in the bush. He also spent twenty five years training 
		  in the martial arts. During his work in a steel mill and underground in a diamond mine, he yearned to be back in the bush and although his profession was Project Manager, 
		  his love of the bush remained. It was during this time that the in-depth research into his first novel - 
		  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00EBGQEXQ/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i4">Zachariah: The Boer Diamond</a> - began.</p>
		  <br>
		  <p>Malcolm now lives with his wife, Lorraine, in Horsham, England when not travelling back to South Africa as an excuse to research for future books. Malcolm has since 
		  written <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0792M4B47/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i3">Ignasius: The Boer Gold</a> and 
		  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B016YJA1TK/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i1">Jedidiah - The Boer Thunder</a></p>
